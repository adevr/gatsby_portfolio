I'm Alexandre Reis, a 21 years old <span>Backend</span> developer, from Aveiro, a city of Portugal!
After my college degree in Economics, I was a little lost in my desires, and I decided to take a High Technician degree in <span>Software Development</span>. This was a two year degree with integrated internship.
<br>
When I started the internship @ <a href="www.loba.pt" target="_blank">LOBA.cx</a>, I already had experience in mid projects, and in plenty technologies of that time, for example:

<span><i></i> Python</span><br>
<span><i></i> Java</span><br>
<span><i></i> Javascript</span><br>
<span><i></i> PHP</span><br>
<br>
In July 2018, I signed my first contract and I was pretty excited about this time in my career.
<br>
In September 2018, I decided to apply to a Bachelor's Degree in <span>Computer Engineering</span>, in order to improve my future and my overall skills. So I started to make a 90km trip
every day, in order to be at the classes and learn the various assignments of the degree. You can learn more about my experience <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.cst.reis/what-is-like-to-be-a-student-worker-47c33422f8e1" target="_blank">here.</a>
<br><br>
During this time, I took online courses like <a href="https://www.zoho.com/creator/training/" target="_blank">ZOHO Creator Developer - Associate</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-rest-pt/" target="_blank">From Zero to Cloud: Restful API with NodeJS, Restify and MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/" target="_blank">Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Introduction to Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git" target="_blank">Learn Git</a>,
and I've read plenty good articles and I've this under my readlist: <span>Clean Code</span> (I'm reading that already), <span>The Clean Coder</span>, <span>Eloquent Javascript</span> and <span>You Know JS collection</span>.
<br><br>
I love to learn new thing and I'm always available to help others to solve problems!
<br>
I consider myself a <span>funny</span> human being, <span>passionate</span>, <span>committed</span>, and also a <span>fast learner</span>!
