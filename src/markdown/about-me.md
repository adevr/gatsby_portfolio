I'm Alexandre Reis, a 21 years old <span>Backend</span> developer, from Aveiro, a city of Portugal!
After my college degree in Economics, I was a little lost in my desires, and I decided to take a High Technician degreen in <span>Software Development</span>. This was a two year degree with integrated internship.

When I started the internship @ <a href="www.loba.pt">LOBA.cx</a>, I already had experience in mid projects, and in plenty technologies of that time, for example:

<span><i></i> Python</span><br>
<span><i></i> Java</span><br>
<span><i></i> Javascript</span><br>
<span><i></i> PHP</span><br>

In July 2018, I signed my first contract and I was pretty excited about this time!
